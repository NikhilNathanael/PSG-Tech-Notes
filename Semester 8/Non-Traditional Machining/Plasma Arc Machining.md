## Plasma
A gas heated > 2000$\degree$ C, molecules separate as atoms
At 3000$\degree$ C or more, electrons dissociate from atom to create an ionized substance consisting of ions and electrons. 

### Characteristics of plasma
- glowing, ionized gas, results from heating of a material to extremely high temperatures
- Composed of free electrons dissociated from the main gas atoms

# **Performance of Water something something**
  Surface speed and MRR  - Optimum
  Max cutting thickness - 150mm 
  Cutting speed = Decreases with increase in thickness 
  Poor tolerances - +- 0.8mm (T<25mm) and +-3.0mm (T>25mm)
  Width of the cut - 2.5 - 9.0 mm
  Taper - 5-7 degree
  Surface finish - 5 - 75 micrometer 
  HAZ (0.75 - 5.0 mm) = Cutting speed and material type
