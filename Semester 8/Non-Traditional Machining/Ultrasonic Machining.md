$$
MRR = K_1 \times K_2 \times K_3 \times f \times \sqrt{\dfrac{L^3}{dg}}
$$
where
  $MRR$ is the Material Removal Rate

## Mechanism of Material Removal
### Throwing Model
This model applies when the particle size is much smaller than the gap between the tool and the workpiece
The abrasive is given a certain velocity towards the workpiece equal to the maximum velocity of the tool

Assuming Sinusoidal vibration of the tool

$$
\begin{align}
Y &=\dfrac{a}{2}\cos {(2\pi ft)} \\
\text{Velocity } V &= \dfrac{a}{2}\times 2\pi f \cos {(2\pi ft)}
\end{align}
$$

Velocity given to the abrasive is the maximum of the tool velocity

$$
\begin{align}
V_{max} &= \pi af
\end{align}
$$

Kinetic energy of abrasive particle

$$
\begin{align}
KE_{abr} &= \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
&= \dfrac{1}{2}m v_{max}^2 
\end{align}
$$



### Problem 1 
Find out the approximate times required to machine a hole of 6mm diameter in a tungsten carbide plate (Flow strength = $6.9\times 10^9 N/m^2$) of thickness equal to $1.5$ times the hole diameter. The mean abrasive grain size is 0.015 mm diameter. The feed force is 3.5 N. The amplitude of tool oscillation is 25 microns. Frequency is 25 kHz. The material is copper (Flow strength = $1.5\times 10^9 N/m^2$). The slurry contains one part of abrasives to one  part of water. Assume $K_1 = 0.3$, $K_2 = 1.8\times 10^-6$; $K_3 = 0.6$. The density of abrasive slurry = $3.8 g/cm^3$. Find also the ratio of the volume removed by throwing mechanism to hammering mechanism
