Localized Spark energy -> Very high temperature -> Melting and vaporization of tool and workpiece material.


How Sparking takes place?
Intense electrical field at the narrowest gap occurs
Negatively charged particles (electrons) detach from the cathode and move towards the anode while positively charged ions move towards the cathode and they form a conducting column of the particles in the interelectrode gap.
