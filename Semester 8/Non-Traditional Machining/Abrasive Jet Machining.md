### Abrasives

- The choice of abrasive particles depends on the type of machining operation
- The abrasive should have a sharp and irregular shape for better performance
- Fine Enough to remain suspended in the carrier gas
- It should have excellent flow characteristics so that narrow and fine areas are reachable to them
- Examples: 
  - $Al_2O_3$ : For cleaning, cutting and deburring
  - $SiC$ : Same as $Al_2O_3$ but for hard materials
  - Glass Beads : 
  - Sodium ...

### Process Parameters
- Abrasive
  - Material : $Al_2O_3$ / $SiC$ / glass beads
  - Shape : irregular/ spherical
  - Size : 10 - 50 $\mu m$ 
  - Mass flow rate : 2 - 20 $g/min$ 
- Carrier gas
  - Composition : Air, $CO_2$, $N_2$
  - Density : Air - 1.3 $kg/m^3$
  - Velocity : 500 - 700 $m/s$
  - Pressure :  2 - 10 bar
  - Flow rate : 5 - 30 lpm
- Abrasive Jet
  - Velocity : 100 - 300 $m/s$
  - Mixing ratio : $\dfrac{M_{abr}}{M_{gas}}$
  - Stand-off distance : 0.5 - 5 mm
  - Impingement angle : $60\degree$ to $90\degree$ 
- Nozzle
  - Material : WC / Sapphire
  - Diameter : (internal) 0.2 - 0.8 $mm$
  - Life : 10 - 300 hours

Mixing Ratio influences MRR
$$
\begin{align}
M &= \dfrac{\text{Volume flow rate of abrasive particles}}{\text{Volume flow rate of carrier gas}} \\ 
M &= \dfrac{V_a}{V_g}
\end{align}
$$

as M increases, MRR also increases
