# Mass Customization
- Mass customization is a marketing and manufacturing technique that combines the flexibility and personalization of custom-made products with the low unit costs associated with mass production. 
- Other names include made-to-order, etc.

| Mass Production                 | Mass Customization            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Stable demand                   | Fragmented demand             |
| Large homogenous markets        | Heterogenous Niches           |
| Low-cost, consistent quality    | Low-cost, high quality        |
| Standardized goods and services | Customized goods and services |

## Attribute for implementation of successful mass customization
- Instantaneousness
  - Modules and process must be linked together very quickly.
  - This allows rapid response to various customer demands
- Costless
  - The linkages must add little, if any, cost to the processes
  - This attribute allows mass customization to be low cost alternative
- Seamless
- Frictionless

## Generic Levels of MC
- Standardization
- Usage 
- Package and distribution
- Additional services
- Additional custom work
- Assembly
- Fabrication
- Design

# 7 steps to illustrate how modularity works to provide mass customization

- Step 1: Customer co-designs//configures their choice product by picking up levels/options for each feature/function available to them within the finite solution space
- Step 2: A mapping mechanism identifies and selects from a list all the product modules/ components that will be needed to make the configured product
- Step 3: Stable and flexible processes are chosen that will fabricate the modules identified in step 2. This is where modular/cellular processes (one process dedicated to one module) are helpful

- Step 5: A schedule is generated, so that each process is triggered when there are enough modules for each process, so as to allow the advantage of economies of scale.
- Step 6: All modules are assembled at the last stage
- Step 7: Customized/pre-configured product is delivered to the customer.
