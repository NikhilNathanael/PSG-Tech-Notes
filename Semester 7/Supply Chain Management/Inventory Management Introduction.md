# Introduction to IM
## Inventory
- It is the stock of items kept to meet future demand
## Inventory Management
Definition : `=[[../../Glossary/Inventory Management|Inventory Management]].definition`
It involves
  - Planning
  - Coordinating and controlling acquisition
  - Storage
  - Handling movement
  - Moment, distribution and possible sales of
    - Raw materials
    - Component parts
    - Subassemblies
    - Supplies and tools
    - Replacement parts
    - and other assets that are needed to meet customer wants and needs
## Purpose of inventory management
- How many units to order? (EOQ)
- When to Order? (ROP)
## Two forms of demand
- Dependent demand
  - Demand for items used to make other items
- Independent demand
  - Demand for items used by external customers
## Reasons to hold inventory
- Time
- Uncertainty
- Economies of Scale
## Reasons to not hold inventory
- Carrying cost
- Valuable factory space
- Obsolescence
- Damage
- Pilferage
## Types of inventory
- Cycle Stock
  - AKA Working Stock
  - It is the portion of inventory available to meet normal demand during a given period
  - $\text{Cycle Stock} = \text{Total on hand inventory} - \text{Safety Stock}$
- Safety Stock
  - It is the extra buffer stock to meet excess demand or protect against delayed shipments from supplier
- Pipeline Inventory
  - It is the inventory which are in the company's shipping chain that are yet to reach their final destination
  - While the items are in transit, they are still considered to be part of the shipper's inventory if the recipient has yet to pay for them
## Inventory Hidden Problems
- Bad Design
- Lengthy Setup time
- Poor Quality
- Inefficient Layout
- Machine Breakdown
- Unreliable Supplier
## Classification of IM Models
- Based on period of inventory restocking
  - Single Period Inventory Model
    - One-time Purchasing Decision
    - Seeks to balance cost of inventory overstock and understock
  - Multi-Period Inventory Models
    - Fixed-Order Quantity Models
      - Event triggered (Example: Running out of stock)
    - Fixed-Time Period Models
      - Time triggered (Example: Monthly sales call by sales representative)
- Based on nature of demand
  - Deterministic Model
    - Used to determine the optimal inventory of a single item when demand is mostly constant
  - Probabilistic Model
    - It incorporates demand variation and lead time uncertainty based on three possibilities
      1. Demand is constant but lead time fluctuates
      2. Is when the lead time is constant but demand fluctuates
- Based on Financial/Function
  - Financial Role
    - Raw material
      - Purchased but not processed
    - WIP
      - Undergone some processing but not completed
      - Depends on cycle time of product
    - Component
      - Light bulbs, nuts, bolts, cleaning materials
      - Necessary to keep machinery and processes productive 
    - Finished Goods
      - Completed product awaiting shipment
  - Function Role
    - Cycle Stock
    - Safety Stock
    - Pipeline Inventory
## Various Cost Element
- Ordering costs ($C_o$)
  - Procuring based on purchase orders
  - It is the service cost of the order, such as processing fees, container costs etc.
  - It includes things like
    - People
    - Transportation
    - Rejection
    - Follow up
- Stockout cost ($C_s$)
  - It is the loss in profit caused by a lack of stock
  - Includes
    - Loss of customer
    - Loss of profit
    - Loss of opportunity
    - Additional capacity
    - Rescheduling
    - Increased freight
- Inventory holding (or) Carrying cost ($C_c$)
  - It is the cost of holding the product in storage
    Includes
    - People
    - Space & power
    - Special requirement
    - Pilferage
    - Cost of capital
    - Obsolete Items
- Unit cost ($C$)
  - It is the cost of one unit of product and it includes the ordering costs, the stockout costs and the inventory costs
  - Startup quality cost
    - Initial Quality assurance or producing defective product

## Aggregate Control of Inventories
- Inventory Turnover ratio
- ABC Classification
- Risk Pooling
