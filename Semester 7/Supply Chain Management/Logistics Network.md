# Network Planning

Three hierarchical Steps

- Network Design
  - Number and locations of manufacturing plants, warehouses
  - Assignment of retail outlets to warehouses
  - Major Sourcing decisions
- Inventory Positioning
  - Identifying stocking points
  - Selecting facilities that will produce to stock and thus keep inventory
  - Facilities that will produce to order and hence keep no inventory
  - Related to the inventory management strategies
- Resource Allocation
  - Determine whether production and packaging of different products is done at the right facility
  - What should be the plants' sourcing strategies?
  - How much capacity each plant should have to meet seasonal demand

## Network model terminology
- Node
      Points (Warehouses, factories, Retail outlets
- Edge
    Connections between nodes
- Network
    Collection of Nodes and Edges

## Network Design Tools
- Mapping
  Mapping allows you to visualize your supply chain and solutions
  Mapping allows you to better understand different scenarios
  Color-coding, sizing, and utilization indicators allow you for further analysis
- Data 
  Input data specifies the costs of the supply chain
  Cost data should match accounting data
  Output data quantifies changes to the supply chain
- Engine
  Optimization techniques used

## Types of network problems in SC
- Shortest Path
  - It is the shortest route from node i to node j
- Travelling salesman
  - It is the shortest route that visits each node exactly once
- Vehicle Routing
  - Least cost sets of tools for vehicle to distribute products from a source node to other demand nodes 
  - The algorithm used plays a major role in the output
- Minimum Cash flow
  - What are the least cash flow of a commodity that fulfills demand at certain sink nodes and does not exceed supply at certain source nodes

## Network Design: Key Issues
- Pick the optimal number, location, and size of warehouses and/or plants
- Determine Optimal Sourcing Strategy
  - Which plant/vendor should produce which product
- Determine Best distribution channels
  - Which warehouses should service which customers

## Types of Network Design Decisions

- Strategic
  - Capital Investment
  - No. of facilities
  - Size of plants
  - Size of Distribution centers
  - Acquisition of new production equipment
  - work center decision of plant
  - Design of transport facilities, communication data processing
- Tactical 
  - Allocation of resources
  - Work force size
  - Inventory policies
  - Defining distribution channel
  - Selection of mode of transportation
- Operational
  - Day-to-Day Operations
  - Assignment of customer order to individual
  - Dispatching, expediting processing order
  - Vehicle scheduling

# Logistics Network
- It is a network used to move goods from their raw state through production and to customers
- to create the most efficient and effective logistics networks, businesses must use logistics network modeling

## Objective
- To design or reconfigure the logistics networks, so as to minimize annual system wide costs, such as production costs, purchasing costs, subject to a variety of service level requirements

## Steps to perform Network Design

 - Data Collection
 - Data Aggregation
 - Transportation Rate
 - Mileage Estimation
 - Warehouse Costs
 - Warehouse Capacities
 - Potential Warehouse Locations
 - Service Level Requirements
 - Future Demand
 - Model and Data Validation

## Data Collection
- A typical network configuration involves a large amount of data
  - Locations of customers, retailers, warehouses, factories, suppliers etc.
  - All available products and their annual demands
  - Transportation costs
  - Warehousing costs

## Data Aggregation
- All these sources create too much data to be handled easily

- Customers located in close proximity to each other can be aggregated using a **grid network**, or **Clustering Techniques**
