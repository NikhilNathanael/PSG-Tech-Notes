# Network Planning

Three hierarchical Steps

- Network Design
  - Number and locations of manufacturing plants, warehouses
  - Assignment of retail outlets to warehouses
  - Major Sourcing decisions
- Inventory Positioning
  - Identifying stocking points
  - Selecting facilities that will produce to stock and thus keep inventory
  - Facilities that will produce to order and hence keep no inventory
  - Related to the inventory management strategies
- Resource Allocation
  - Determine whether production and packaging of different products is done at the right facility
  - What should be the plants' sourcing strategies?
  - How much capacity each plant should have to meet seasonal demand

## Network model terminology
- Node
      Points (Warehouses, factories, Retail outlets
- Edge
    Connections between nodes
- Network
    Collection of Nodes and Edges

## Network Design Tools
- Mapping
  Mapping allows you to visualize your supply chain and solutions
  Mapping allows you to better understand different scenarios
  Color-coding, sizing, and utilization indicators allow you for further analysis
- Data 
  Input data specifies the costs of the supply chain
  Cost data should match accounting data
  Output data quantifies changes to the supply chain
- Engine
  Optimization techniques used

## Types of network problems in SC
- Shortest Path
  - It is the shortest route from node i to node j
- Travelling salesman
  - It is the shortest route that visits each node exactly once
- Vehicle Routing
  - Least cost sets of tools for vehicle to distribute products from a source node to other demand nodes 
  - The algorithm used plays a major role in the output
- Minimum Cash flow
  - What are the least cash flow of a commodity that fulfills demand at certain sink nodes and does not exceed supply at certain source nodes

## Network Design: Key Issues
- Pick the optimal number, location, and size of warehouses and/or plants
- Determine Optimal Sourcing Strategy
  - Which plant/vendor should produce which product
- Determine Best distribution channels
  - Which warehouses should service which customers

## Types of Network Design Decisions

- Strategic
  - Capital Investment
  - No. of facilities
  - Size of plants
  - Size of Distribution centers
  - Acquisition of new production equipment
  - work center decision of plant
  - Design of transport facilities, communication data processing
- Tactical 
  - Allocation of resources
  - Work force size
  - Inventory policies
  - Defining distribution channel
  - Selection of mode of transportation
- Operational
  - Day-to-Day Operations
  - Assignment of customer order to individual
  - Dispatching, expediting processing order
  - Vehicle scheduling

# Logistics Network
- It is a network used to move goods from their raw state through production and to customers
- to create the most efficient and effective logistics networks, businesses must use logistics network modeling

## Objective
- To design or reconfigure the logistics networks, so as to minimize annual system wide costs, such as production costs, purchasing costs, subject to a variety of service level requirements

## Steps to perform Network Design

1. Data Collection
2. Data Aggregation
3. Transportation Rate
4. Mileage Estimation
5. Warehouse Costs
6. Warehouse Capacities
7. Potential Warehouse Locations
8. Service Level Requirements
9. Future Demand
10. Model and Data Validation
