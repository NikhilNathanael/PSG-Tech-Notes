# Bullwhip effect
A small change in the demand by the customer is amplified back through each stage of the supply chain and becomes an extremely large variability in the supplier stage. 
The size of bullwhip effect is amplified with more stages in the supply chain 

## Methods for reducing Bullwhip Effect
- Reduce uncertainty in the SC
  - Centralized demand information
  - More frequent planning
  - POS data
- Reduce variability in the SC
  - EDLP

### EDLP 
Everyday low price is a pricing strategy promising consumers a low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping.
EDLP saves retail stores the effort and expense needed to mark down prices in the store during sale events, and is also believed to generate shopper loyalty
