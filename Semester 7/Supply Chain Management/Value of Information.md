# Introduction
Having accurate information about inventory levels, orders, production, and delivery status throughout the supply chain should not make the managers of a supply chain less effective than if this information were not available

DSS - Decision support system

# Availability of information 
Helps reduce variability in the supply chain
Helps suppliers make better forecasts, accounting for promotions and market changes
Enables the coordination of manufacturing and distribution systems and strategies. 
Enables the retailer to better serve their customers by offering tools for locating desired items
# Information Types
- Inventory Levels
- Orders
- Production
- Delivery Status

# Bullwhip effect
A small change in the demand by the customer is amplified back through each stage of the supply chain and becomes an extremely large variability in the supplier stage. 
The size of bullwhip effect is amplified with more stages in the supply chain 

Even if the consumer demand is near constant, the demand order variabilities in the supply chain were amplified as they moved up the supply chain, This phenomenon is called bullwhip effect.

## What causes Bullwhip effect?
- More 
  - Number of layers
  - Delay
  - Rate of Change
- Each Layer
  - Updates it's forecast in varying patterns 
  - Places order at different times
  - Price fluctuations (Promotions)
  - Rationing of Supply

## Factors contributing to Bullwhip Effect
- Demand forecasting update
  - This occurs when all parties in the supply chain make adjustments to compensate for negative data received from downstream members.
  - If the chain is long, the level of inaccuracy increases
  - This can causes sudden variability in demand
- Batch Ordering
  - Placing frequent orders for small quantities creates less of a bullwhip effect than placing larger orders less frequently
- Price Fluctuation
  - The term "Price volatility" is used to describe the price fluctuations of a commodity
  - The degree of variation, not the level of prices, defines a volatile market
  - Since Price is a function of supply and demand, it follows that volatility is a result of the underlying supply and demand characteristics of the market
- Lead times 
  - Longer lead times exacerbate the bullwhip effect
- Inflated orders
  - When retailers expect that a product will be in short supply, they will tend to inflate orders to insure that they will have an ample supply to meet customer demand.
  - When the shortage period comes to an end, the retailer goes back to the smaller orders, thus causing more variability

## Impact of Centralized information on Bullwhip effect
- Centralize demand information within a supply chain
  - Provide each stage of supply chain with complete information on the actual customer demand
  - Creates more accurate forecasts rather than orders received from the next stage
## Methods for reducing Bullwhip Effect
- Reduce uncertainty in the SC
  - Centralized demand information
  - More frequent planning
  - POS data
- Reduce variability in the SC
  - EDLP
- Reduce Lead times
  - Cross docking
  - Electronic Data Interchange
- Eliminate the bullwhip through strategic partnering
  - VMI 
  - CPFR
### Direct Shipment with Milk Runs
- A milk run is  a regular load to pick up mixed loads from several suppliers
- A combined or consolidated delivery from multiple suppliers is often a part of milk runs.
- Direct Shipments with milk runs consolidates multiple vendors' deliveries into one direct shipment to the customer, enabling the customer to process one full truck load instead of multiple less-than-full shipments

## Cross-Docking
- It is a system for packing products on incoming shipments to ease sorting at intermediate warehouses or on outgoing shipments, based on their final destinations
### EDLP 
Everyday low price is a pricing strategy promising consumers a low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping.
EDLP saves retail stores the effort and expense needed to mark down prices in the store during sale events, and is also believed to generate shopper loyalty

# Framework for supply chain coordination initiatives

| Causes of Bullwhip     | Information sharing                                 | Channel alignment                             | Operational efficiency                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demand forecast update | Understanding System dynamics - Using POS, EDI, CAO | Using VMI, Discount, Consumer direct          | By Lt reduction, Echelon based inventory                 |
| Order Batching         | EDI - Internet Ordering                             | Discount for truck load, deliver appointments | Reduction in fixed cost of ordering by EDI or E-Commerce |
| Price Fluctuation      |                                                     | Continuous replenishment , Everyday Low Price | Activity based costing                                   |
| Shortage Gaming        | Sharing sale, Capacity & Inventory Data             | Allocation based on part sales                |                                                          |
