# Pull Based Supply Chain
In a pull-based supply chain, production and distribution are demand driven so that they are coordinated with true customer demand rather than with forecast demand.
In a pure pull system, the firm does not hold any inventory and only responds to specific order.
This is enabled by fast information flow mechanisms that transfer information about customer demand (e.g. point of sale data) to the various supply chain participants. 

# Push-Pull Supply Chains
It is a hybrid supply chain in which the push strategy is used for the parts which have low uncertainty and pull strategy is used for the parts with high uncertainty

# Selecting the best SC Strategy
- Higher demand uncertainty suggests Pull
- Higher importance of economies of scale suggest push
- High uncertainty/EOS not important such as the computer industry implies pull
- Low uncertainty/EOS important such as groceries implies push
  - Demand is stable
  - Transportation cost reduction is critical 
  - Pull would not be appropriate here
