# Problem 1
The demand for the iWidget is very steady at 15000 units per month with virtually no variability.
The iWidgets are manufactured in China, assembled in Brazil, and shipped to your Dallas, Texas distribution center for delivery to the US market. The product cost, excluding transportation, of an iWidget to your DC is Rs. 125 per unit. The sales price across all of your channels averages Rs. 575 per unit. The ordering process costs Rs. 275 to place an order. All orders are shipper in containers that cost Rs. 1250 per container, regardless of how many iWidgets are in the container as long as the number does not exceed the container capacity of 5,000 iWidgets. You also have to order in multiples of 100. Your company has an annual holding cost of 25% of unit cost. Assume 52 weeks per year.
1. What is the economic order quantity of iWidgets?
2. What is your order cycle time, T, in days.
3. What is the Total Annual Cost?

$$
\begin{align}
EOQ &= \sqrt(\dfrac{2DC_o}{C_c}) \\
EOQ &= \sqrt{\dfrac{2\times15000\times (275+1250)}{0.25\times 125}} \\
EOQ &= 1209.9586769803
\end{align}
