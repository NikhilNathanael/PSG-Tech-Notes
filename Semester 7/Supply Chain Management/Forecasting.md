# Forecasting
- It is the process of predicting conditions in the future based on present conditions
- It is used in inventory management to try to reduce inventory costs and opportunity costs by matching inventory levels to required amounts
## Forecasting Time Horizons
- Short Range forecasts 
  - Upto 1 year, usually less than 3 months
  - Purchasing, job scheduling, workforce levels, jog assignments, productions levels
  - Tend to be more accurate than other types
- Medium range forecasts
  - 3 months to 3 years
  - Sales and production planning, budgeting
- Long-range forecasts
  - 3+ years
  - New product planning, facility location, R&D

## Types of Forecasts
- Economic Forecasts
- Demographic Forecasts
- Technological Forecasts
- Other Forecasts
- Business Forecasts
  - Involving demand and sales forecasts
  
## Strategic Importance of Forecasting
- Human Resources 
  - Hiring, Training, Laying off workers
- Capacity
  - Capacity shortages can result in undependable delivery, Loss of customers, Loss of Market share
- Supply Chain Mananagement 
  - Good Supplier relations and price advantages

## Forecasting Factors
- Time required in future
- Availability of historical data
- Relevance of historical data into future
- Demand and sales variability patterns
- Required forecasting accuracy and likely errors
- Planning horizon/lead time for operational moves

### Seven steps in Forecasting
- Determine the use of the forecast 
- Select the items to be forecasted
- Determine the time horizon of the forecast 
- Select the forecasting model(s)
- Gather the data
- Make the forecast 
- Validate and implement results and 

## Forecasting Approaches
### Qualitative Methods
- Used when the situation is vague and the little data exists
  - New products
  - New Technology
- Involves intuition, experience
  - Forecasting sales on internet

### Quantitative Methods
- Used when the situation is "Stable" and lots of historical data exists
  - Existing Products
  - Current Technology
- Involves mathematical techniques
- Forecasting sales of color televisions

## What is Demand Management?
- Demand management is one that takes a complete view of a business
- It means discovering markets, planning products and services for those markets and then fulfilling these customer demands
- It is an integrative set of business processes, across, not just the enterprise, but across all its trading partner network (both customers and suppliers)

### What does demand management involve?
- Discovering and understanding your market
- Establishing Customer's needs and expectations and what draws them to your business
- Challenge of managing what, when, and how a product/service is designed, made, distributed, displayed, promoted and serviced
- Doing the pricing and inventory optimization at various levels of market and channels segmentation
- Satisfying customers on product, price, deliver, and post-sales services

## What is demand forecasting?
 - Demand forecasting is predicting the future demand for products/services of an organization
 - These estimates are not necessarily 100% accurate

### Why demand forecasting?
- To help decide of facility capacity planning and capital budgeting 
- To help evaluate market opportunities worthy of future investments
- To help assess its market share amongst other competitors
- To serve as input to aggregate production planning and materials requirement planning
- To plan for other organizational inputs (like manpower, funds and financing) and setting policies and procedures

## Key functions of forecasting
- It is used as an estimation tool
- Way to address the complex and uncertain business environment issues
- A tool to predict events related to operations planning and control
- A vital prerequisite for the overall business planning process

## Forecasting's Role in the supply chain
- Forms basis for all strategic and planning decisions in a supply chain
- Used for both push and pull processes

## Planning Sequence
- **Master Schedule**
  - Establishes schedules for specific products
  - **Aggregate Plan**
    - Establishes operations capacity
    - **Business plan**
      - Establishes operations and capacity strategies
      - **Corporate strategies and policies**
      - **Economic, competitive, and political conditions**
      - **Aggregate demand forecasts**

#### Aggregate planning Inputs
- Resources 
  - Workforce/production rate
  - Facilities and equipment
- Demand Forecast
- Policies
  - Subcontracting
  - Overtime
  - Inventory Levels
  - Back Orders
- Costs
  - Inventory Carrying 
  - Back Orders
  - Hiring/Firing
  - Overtime
  - Inventory Changes
  - Subcontracting

#### Aggregate Planning Outputs
- Total cost of a plan
- Projected Levels of 
  - Inventory 
  - Output
  - Employment
  - Subcontracting
  - Backordering

## Role of an Aggregate Planning in a Supply Chain
- Given Demand forecast over a planning horizon, we can determine the production level, inventory level, and the capacity level for each period that maximizes the firm's profit over the planning horizon
- All supply chain stages should work together on an aggregate plan that will optimize supply chain performance

## Types of Forecasting Methods
Depend on 
  - Time Frame
    - *Same as before*
  - Demand Behavior
    - Trend
    - Random Variations
    - Cycle
    - Seasonal Pattern
  - Causes of Behavior

## Rules of Forecasting
- Forecasting is always wrong
- The longer the horizon, the worse the forecast
- Aggregate forecasts are more accurate

### Utility of Forecasts
- Part of the tools available to a manager
- Despite difficulties with forecasts, it can be used for a variety of decisions
- Number of techniques allow practical use of forecasts as needed

## Techniques
- Judgement Methods
  - Sales-force composite
  - Experts panel
  - Delphi Method
    - Several Experts are asked questions over multiple rounds and the answers are aggregated
    - Experts can adjust their answers after each round based on the others' answers
- Market Research/Survey
- Time Series
  - Moving averages
  - Exponential Smoothing
- Trends
  - Regression
  - Holt's Method
- Seasonal Patterns - Seasonal Decomposition
- Trend + Seasonality - Winter's Method
- Causal Methods

## Most Appropriate Technique's selection
- Purpose of forecast
- How will the forecast be used?
- Dynamics of the system for which forecast will be made
- How accurate is the past history in predicting the future?
- How accurate is the past history in predicting the future?
