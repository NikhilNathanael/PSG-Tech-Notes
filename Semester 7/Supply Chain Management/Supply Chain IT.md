## Analysis based on Supply Chain Data

Data analysis should take into account the global supply chain picture
Information system must be utilized to find the most efficient ways to produce, assemble, warehouse and distribute products

## Collaboration with Supply Chain Partners

- Ability to collaborate is key for most companies
- Sophisticated alignment of IT systems
- Integration of business processes
- Collaboration among supply chain partners
  - Ability to link and work effectively with suppliers through supplier relationship management (SRM) systems.
  - Collaboration platforms, whether private or public 
  - Customer relationship management (CRM) systems to provide better contact and understanding of customer needs

## Other issues

- Four goals of supply chain management
  - Do not all have to be achieved at the same time
  - Not necessarily dependent of each other
  - Can be targeted in parallel

## SCM System Components

ERP Systems
- Attempt to resolve, bring all business functions together to make an enterprise more efficient
- Do not help answer the fundamental questions of what should be made, where, when, and for whom. 
- Such decisions made by human planners using various analytical tools such as Decision-Support Systems (DSS)

## DSS
- Range from spreadsheets to expert systems
- Appropriate DSS depends on:
  - Nature of the problem, the planning horizon, and the type of decisions that need to be made.
- DSS helps in the analysis
- of
  - At various planning levels
  - Exact nature depends on manufacturing characteristics, demand fluctuations, transportation costs, and inventory costs.

### Data analysis Techniques in DSS
- **Queries**
  - Vast quantities of data make manual analysis difficult.
  - Decisions often facilitated by simply asking specific questions about the data
- **Data Mining**
  - With larger corporate databases
  - New tools to look for "Hidden" patterns, trends, and relationships in the data
- Online analytical processing (OLAP) tools 
  - An intuitive way to view corporate data, typically stored in data warehouses.
  - Aggregates data along common business dimensions
  - Let users navigate through the hierarchies and dimensions by drilling data up and down

- Display and report based on the specific problem being solved. 
- Uses analytical tools that have some specific embedded knowledge of the problem being solved.

## Applications and Analytical Tools

| **Problem**                     | **Tools Used**                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Marketing                       | Query, Statistics, Datamining             |
| Routing                         | Heuristics, exact algorithms              |
| Production Scheduling           | Simulation, heuristics, dispatch rules    |
| Logistics network configuration | Simulations, heuristics, exact algorithms |
| Mode selection                  | Heuristics, exact algorithms              |

## Priorities when implementing DSS

| Industry               | DSS                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Soft Drink distributor | Network and transportation        |
| Computer manufacturer  | Demand and manufacturing          |
| Consumer Products      | Demand and distribution           |
| Apparel                | Demand, capacity and distribution |
