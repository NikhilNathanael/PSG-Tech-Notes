# Pull Based Supply Chain
In a pull-based supply chain, production and distribution are demand driven so that they are coordinated with true customer demand rather than with forecast demand.
In a pure pull system, the firm does not hold any inventory and only responds to specific order.
This is enabled by fast information flow mechanisms that transfer information about customer demand (e.g. point of sale data) to the various supply chain participants. 

# Selecting the best SC Strategy
- Higher demand uncertainty suggests Pull
- Higher importance of economies of scale suggest push
- High uncertainty/EOS not important such as the computer industry implies pull
- Low uncertainty/EOS important such as groceries implies push
  - Demand is stable
  - Transportation cost reduction is critical 
  - Pull would not be appropriate here

# Characteristics and skills
| **Push System**         | **Pull System**       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Low uncertainty     | High uncertainty  |
| Long lead times     | Short Cycle Times |
| Cost Minimization   | Service Level     |
| Resource Allocation | Responsiveness    |

# Push-Pull Supply Chains
It is a hybrid supply chain in which the push strategy is used for the parts which have low uncertainty and pull strategy is used for the parts with high uncertainty

The push section requires
- Supply chain planning
- Long term strategies
The Pull section requires
- Order fulfillment processes
- Customer relationship management
Buffer inventory at the boundaries
- The output of the tactical planning process
- The input to the order fulfillment process
