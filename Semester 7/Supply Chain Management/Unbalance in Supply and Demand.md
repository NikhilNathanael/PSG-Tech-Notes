Mismatch between demand and supply can occur in two ways
- Over stocking ($S > D$)
  - It means the available supply is greater than demand
  - It causes an increase in average cost due to increase in the inventory cost
- Under stocking ($S < D$)
  - It means the available supply is less than the demand
  - It cause an increase in the average cost by causing shortage and a loss in customer trust


# Uncertainty in SCM
## Customer Uncertainty
- Demand varies along certain attributes
  - Quantity in each lot
  - Response time
  - Variety of product needed
  - Service price
## Supplier Uncertainty
- Supply varies along certain attribute
  - Strongly affected by the life cycle position of the product
  - New products
  - Frequency of breakdown
  - Unpredictable demand and low yield
  - Poor quality
  - Limited capacity
  - Supply chain inflexibility

# Effect of demand uncertainty
- Higher demand uncertainty leads to a preference for [[Pull Strategy]]
- Lower demand uncertainty leads to an interest in managing the supply chain based on a long term forecasting using push strategy
