### Warehousing Costs
- Handling Costs
	- Labor and utility costs
	- Proportional to annual flow through the warehouse
- Fixed Costs
	- All cost components not proportional to the amount of flow
	- Typically proportional to warehouse size (capacity) but in an non-linear way
- Storage Costs
	- Inventory holding costs
	- Proportional to average positive inventory levels

Estimating warehouse costs is fairly easy while estimating the other tow costs value is quite difficult

The amount of space needed by a warehouse needs to account for its peak inventory

## Typical Network Design Model
### Solution Techniques
- Mathematical optimization techniques
	1. Heuristics :Find "Good" Solutions, not necessarily optimal
	2. Exact Algorithms : Find optimal solutions
- Simulation models 

#### Problem 1
