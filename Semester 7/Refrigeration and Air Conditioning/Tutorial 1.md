##### Problem 2
A Carnot refrigeration cycle absorbs heat at $-12\degree C$ and rejects heat at $40\degree C$ 
  a. Calculate the COP of this refrigeration cycle
  b. If the cycle is absorbing 15 kW at $-12\degree C$ temperature, how much power is required?
  c. If a Carnot heat pump operates between the same temperatures as the above refrigeration cycle, what is the performance factor?
  d. What is the rate of heat rejection at the $40\degree C$ temperature if the heat pump absorbs 15 kW at the $-12\degree C$ side?
