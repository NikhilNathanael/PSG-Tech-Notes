# Disadvantages of Embedded Systems

- Needs high development effort
- Low memory
- Need special systems to program

# Types of Embedded Systems
## Microcontroller based Systems
- Processor with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces 
- Widely used in simple tasks
## Microprocessor Based Systems
- Processor with external chips for memory and peripheral interfaces
- Connect more devices on the board
- Expansion and selection of exact peripherals
- Larger embedded systems
