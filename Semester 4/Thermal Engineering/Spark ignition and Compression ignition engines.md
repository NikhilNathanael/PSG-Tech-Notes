Spark Ignition
- What the hell do you want
- Fuel is highly volatile
- Ignites due to spark plug
- High speed engines due to light weight
- CR is 6 to 10
- Lower thermal efficiency
- Throttle controlled quantity of mixture
[[../Euler's Energy Equations]]

Compression Ignition engines
- Diesel Cycle
- Fuel is non-volatile
- Ignites due to compression
- Low speed engines due to high weight
- CR is 16 to 20
- Higher thermal efficiency
- Air quantity is not controlled
