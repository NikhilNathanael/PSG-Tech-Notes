[[Heat and Combustion Engines]]

4 - stroke
- 1 power stroke per 2 revolutions
- Heavier flywheel is required
- Power density is lower
- Less cooling and lubrication is needed
- Initial cost is higher
- Higher volumetric efficiency
- Higher thermal efficiency
- Used when efficiency is more important than weight
